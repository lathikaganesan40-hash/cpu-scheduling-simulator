# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## 📌 Project Overview

The **CPU Scheduling Simulator** is a Python-based application that simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms used in Operating Systems.

This project helps in understanding how different scheduling strategies affect:

* Waiting Time (WT)
* Turnaround Time (TAT)
* Process Execution Order
* CPU Utilization

It is designed for educational purposes and academic learning in Operating Systems.

## 🚀 Features

* User-friendly interface
* Process table creation
* Simulation of multiple scheduling algorithms
* Automatic calculation of:

  * Completion Time (CT)
  * Waiting Time (WT)
  * Turnaround Time (TAT)
* Comparative analysis between algorithms

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2. Shortest Job First (SJF) – Non-Preemptive
3. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) – Preemptive
4. Round Robin (RR)

These are fundamental scheduling algorithms studied in Operating Systems.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Tkinter (for GUI)
